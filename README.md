## Projects
### Flight Delay Prediction
Analyzed flight data to identify high-traffic airports like Atlanta, Chicago, and airlines with the
most delays, including Southwest Airlines. Designed a big data architecture using Apache Spark, MongoDB, and PySpark to
efficiently handle and clean over 120 million records of flights, reducing compressed data from 12GB to 1.6GB. Developed
interactive data visualizations using Tableau to identify seasonal trends in flight delays and potential bottlenecks in airport
infrastructure such as MLB, Florida with the highest taxi-in time despite lower traffic.
Technologies: PySpark
